# Q&A Forum App

Q&A Forum application, a full-stack platform built with React, Node.js (Express.js), and MySQL2.
This project was independently designed to create a user-friendly forum, allowing users to ask questions, provide and vote for the answers, similar to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).

The project follows a microservices architecture with separate services for user registration, login, questions, and answers. Each service has dedicated routes, controllers, and models, sharing a common database. Communication is streamlined through a unified API under the '/api' endpoint, promoting modularity.

React-powered interface leverages React components and hooks to deliver real-time updates.

To use all the functionality of the website, you need to register your own user account or login using the following credentials:

- Email: `hermionegranger@email.com`
- Password: `secret123`

Note that users can only modify and delete their own questions and answers.

- **Full-Stack Design**: Independently crafted the project design, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience.
- **User Authentication**: Incorporated JSON tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Data Validation**: Implemented validation both in the backend and frontend for robust data integrity.
